# odin-recipes

This project is based on HTML basics, where i built a website that consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I have learned how to set up the boilerplate HTML, how to create headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, how to make bold and italic text, also, i can use <br> to make a new line while writing on a paragraph.
