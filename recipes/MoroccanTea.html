        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            Moroccan mint tea is one of the many rites and traditions that surround tea. Although its history is quite recent, this recipe has been exported to many countries thanks to its refreshing virtues and its unique taste, which appeals to tea lovers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mint tea is everywhere and all the time in Morocco. This could suggest that this drink is ancestral, straight from the dawn of time. And yet this is not the case. Today, no one can take a step without meeting men seated at the terrace of a cafe and sipping delicious golden and very fragrant tea, no one can try to buy a product of local crafts without sacrificing the tea ceremony. Family reunions cannot be done without it, bivouacs in the desert either, everyone consumes this drink throughout the territory. In addition, it is the emblematic representation of the art of welcome, a strong reality in Morocco.

            How, in this case, not to think that this habit was born for centuries and that tea is now inscribed in the genes of everyone!
